📊 A visual scouting report on **One Knoxville SC**'s build-up and attacking tendencies from the last 4 games (as of 7/20) of the 2025 USL League One season.

## 🔍 Scouting Process

This project was created by manually tracking tactical tendencies from match film and visualizing them for coaching analysis. The process included:

- Watching 4 full matches via **ESPN+**
- Tracking build-up and final third attacking zones (Left, Center, Right)
- Tracking mode of attack, play style, individual performance, distribution
- Free kick takers and tendencies
- Cross-checking observations with **FBref**
- Creating visual heatmaps using **Python**, **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**
