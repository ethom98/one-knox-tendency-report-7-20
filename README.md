📊 A visual scouting report on **One Knoxville SC**'s build-up and attacking tendencies from the last 4 games (as of 7/20) of the 2025 USL League One season.

## 🔍 Scouting Process

This project was created by manually tracking tactical tendencies from match film and visualizing them for coaching analysis. The process included:

- Watching 4 full matches via **ESPN+**
- Tracking build-up and final third attacking zones (Left, Center, Right)
- Tracking mode of attack, play style, individual performance, distribution
- Free kick takers and tendencies
- Cross-checking observations with **FBref**
- Creating visual heatmaps using **Python**, **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**

## 🔮 Predicted Scoreline

**Chattanooga Red Wolves 2 - 1 One Knoxville SC**

This Tennessee Derby is expected to be a tightly contested match, but Chattanooga holds the edge based on recent form and tactical matchups:

* **Defensive Solidity:** Chattanooga has conceded just *3 goals across their last 4 matches*, often forcing opponents into wide areas and low-percentage shots. Their narrow mid-block limits central penetration—precisely where One Knox struggles to create.

* **Exploiting Forced Play:** One Knoxville prefers a possession-first, defense-to-attack build-up model. However, when trailing, they tend to force chances—leading to turnovers and exposure in transition. Chattanooga has shown they can punish these moments with **direct attacking transitions** and set piece efficiency.

* **Efficiency in Attack:** The Red Wolves average **1.4 goals per game over their last 5 matches**, and often convert a high proportion of their big chances. Against a One Knox side that can overcommit, this may prove decisive.

* **Home Field & Momentum:** Chattanooga is unbeaten at home in 3 straight matches and enters with momentum following a hard-earned draw vs top opposition.

> 📊 **Prediction:** Chattanooga will frustrate One Knox’s build-up, strike on the counter, and edge out a 2–1 win.
